# 🍽️ Ova Food – Flutter Prototype

Ova Food developed at **Ovaar** in less than a week based on a Dribbble design.  
This project demonstrates our ability to turn a static mockup into a smooth, beautiful, and functional app.

## 🧠 Why this prototype?

At **Ovaar**, we regularly build complex automation systems, often powered by AI, to help our clients gain efficiency,
reliability, and speed.  
But let’s be honest:

👉 A powerful backend system doesn’t make for a great picture.

So when we stumbled upon an inspiring Dribbble design, we took the opportunity to show off our **frontend skills** too:

> Turn a static mockup into a real Flutter app – fast, fluid, and functional.
